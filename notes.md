<h1> Inception - </h1>

- React is a JS library for interacting with Browser's DOM.

Difference between Library and a framework -

- Library --> Used to build specific use-cases and it's a simple code to achieve one particular use-case.

- Framework --> End to end support for one application, used to build system.

* `document` and `window` are two objects which are injected by the javascript engine in the browser. 


* We create an element using `react` and render it using `ReactDOM`, it utilizes the `div` created in *index.html* file - so it is more important than we think.

- ReactDOM.createRoot().render is the function that tells React what to render and where to render it. This function takes in a element and a container.


* While serving react's CDN - `crossorigin` is being used  
 to allow data from *cross-origin* to be served. By default the browsers would allow only *same-origin* policy requests.
